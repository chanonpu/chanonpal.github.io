    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      In 2022, I found myself feeling bored at work and decided to explore something new: I started learning Java. 
      To my surprise, I discovered a passion for coding and problem-solving that I never knew I had. 
      This newfound love for programming led me to enroll at Humber College in Toronto, 
      where I'm honing my skills with a focus on creating user-friendly applications.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      My main goal is to develop software that not only meets user needs but also provides an enjoyable experience. 
      I thrive on challenges and enjoy finding solutions to complex problems.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I have a few hobbies that keep me balanced. I love making coffeeâ€”there's something special about 
      brewing the perfect cup. When I'm not experimenting with coffee beans, you can find me playing games, 
      where I can immerse myself in different worlds and narratives.
